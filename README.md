# Least-Squares-Trilateration
Trilateration example using least squares method in scipy

## Method
The first file [[ Least-Squares-Trilateration/Result Using Simulated Points In Pandas.ipynb ]] takes 9 points which have a range to an unknown point.  

The second file [[ Least-Squares-Trilateration/scipy.optimize.least_squares.ipynb ]]takes a large number of points, finds the "best" 500 and uses these in the least squares equations. 

Trilateration enables the unknown point to be found. However a since there are a number of samples a non linear least squares method needs to be used to find the solution that has the least error.
