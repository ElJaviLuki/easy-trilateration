# Least-Squares-Trilateration
Trilateration example using least squares method in scipy

## Method
This example takes 10 points which have a range to an unknown point.  

Trilateration enables the unknown point to be found. However a since there are a number of samples a non linear least squares method needs to be used to find the solution that has the least error. 


## Test Data Generation
There is a separate script to generate some test data.
